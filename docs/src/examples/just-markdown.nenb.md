This file just contains typical Markdown.  The page's title is the
base name of the generated file.

Below is a table, which looks nice because of some default css styling, and
shows that some amount of "extended" Markdown is supported.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
