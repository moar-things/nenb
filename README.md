Programmable, editable online notebooks are awesome. Like
[Mathematica][], [TiddlyWiki][], [Jupyter][], [Runkit][], and
[Observable].  I do find the "online editing" experience to be less than
optimal though - I'm happier in a high-function text editor like [Atom][]
or [Sublime Text][].  And do I really need to be able to edit my notebooks
in the same place I'm viewing them in a web browser?

Let's find out!

`nenb` is an experiment that allows you to author a "notebook" in plain ole
Markdown in a plain ole editor, and then have that "notebook" compiled to HTML.
